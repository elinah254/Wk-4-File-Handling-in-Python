# 📁 Week 4 - File Handling in Python
File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

This project is part of the Power Learn Project Academy assignments. It focuses on reading from, writing to, modifying, and managing files using Python. It also introduces basic error handling techniques for working with files safely.

## 📌 What’s Inside?

- `read_and_write_file.py`  
  Reads content from `source.txt`, converts it to uppercase, counts words, and appends the modified output to `modified.txt`.

- `error_handling_lab.py`  
  Accepts a file name from the user and displays its content. Handles errors like missing files, permission issues, or unexpected exceptions.

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

- File Reading & Writing in Python  
- Using Context Managers (`with open(...)`)  
- Modifying File Content (e.g. `.upper()`, `.lower()`)  
- Word Count with `split()`  
- Appending vs Overwriting Files  
- Python Error Handling with `try`, `except`, `FileNotFoundError`, and more
